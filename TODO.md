Thing I need to get done, by role, in priority order.
### Roles
Role specific tasks
#### Common
- TAGS

Create a defined set of tags for the common role. I think the following are a sensible set.
```
common_install
common_uninstall
common_configure
common_check
```
- MOTD
Tidy up the MOTD, and add role specific comments.


#### IDM

- TAGS

Create a defined set of tags for IDM. I think the following are a sensible set.
```
idm_install
idm_uninstall
idm_configure
idm_disable
idm_check
```
